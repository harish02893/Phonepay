# Phonepe_Pulse_Data_Visualization

Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration:
A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly


#**Technologies**
Github Cloning, Python, Pandas, MySQL,
mysql-connector-python, Streamlit, and Plotly.


**The learning outcomes of this project:**
1. Data extraction and processing: You will learn how to use Clone Github to
extract data from a repository and pre-process the data using Python libraries
such as Pandas.
2. Database management: You will learn how to use a relational database such
as MySQL to store data and retrieve it efficiently for analysis and visualization.
3. Visualization and dashboard creation: You will learn how to use libraries
such as Streamlit and Plotly to create interactive and visually appealing
dashboards for data visualization.
4. Geo visualization: You will learn how to create and display data on a map
using Plotly's built-in geo map functions.
5. Dynamic updating: You will learn how to create a dashboard that
dynamically updates based on the latest data in a database.
6. Project development and deployment: You will learn how to develop a
comprehensive and user-friendly solution, from data extraction to dashboard
deployment. You will also learn how to test and deploy the solution to ensure it
is secure, efficient, and user-friendly.
By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience with data extraction,
processing, and visualization, as well as experience working with databases,
dashboards, and web development. This project will provide a foundation for further
learning and development in these areas and help you build a portfolio of practical
skills.
